# Compiler
I designed a recursive desent parser which was required to read user input and build a comprehensive data structure storing both variables and the structural characteristics of each function call. The data structure was required to be compatible with a given compiler companion file which only accepts the head node of a the newly created data structure. The program was required to build the data structure at runtime, determine what kind of fuction call is being made and how to connect the node and its follow paths into a single node that came prior to the new node. This project required we follow elements of graph based data structures, as opposed to a singly linear data structures such as a linked list or an array. This was required since a graph with multiple nodes connected with one another will help increase efficency and readibility. The program I had designed was required to recognize variable declarations, assignment, if, while, and switch statements as string input. Then build a data structure where each node houses elements pertaining to statement type, operands of a boolean statement, and where the node follows if it is true or false. Assignment statements connects via pointers to value nodes that determine what arithmetic operation to conduct. Overall the purpose of this project was to understand how a compiler builds the code provided at compile-time and how it subsequently organizes its logic path in the form of data structures.
